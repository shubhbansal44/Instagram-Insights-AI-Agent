# Instagram Insights Agent

## Project Description
The **Instagram Insights Agent** is an advanced AI-driven system designed to analyze Instagram data and provide actionable insights. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs), this agent enables users to extract detailed information, identify trends, and optimize content strategies based on real data.

## Key Features

### 1. **Data Retrieval and Analysis**
- Fetches post-specific details using unique `post_id`s from a provided dataset.
- Extracts critical metrics such as post type (e.g., photo, video, reel), likes, comments, and captions for precise analysis.

### 2. **Insight Generation**
- Calculates averages and engagement metrics to provide a clear picture of overall content performance.
- Identifies top-performing posts based on metrics like total engagement (likes + comments).
- Determines the most popular content formats and optimal posting strategies.

### 3. **Trend Identification**
- Analyzes engagement patterns, posting times, and content formats to highlight trends.
- Offers actionable recommendations to improve audience interaction and content reach.

### 4. **Custom Query Handling**
- Handles user-specific queries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation to fetch and analyze relevant data from the dataset.
- Provides detailed, structured, and concise responses tailored to user needs.

## How It Works
1. **Input**: Users provide a dataset containing Instagram post details and specific questions or post IDs.
2. **Processing**: The agent processes the input and retrieves relevant data using advanced retrieval tools.
3. **Output**: Insights and recommendations are generated based on the retrieved data, enabling users to optimize their Instagram content and engagement strategies.
